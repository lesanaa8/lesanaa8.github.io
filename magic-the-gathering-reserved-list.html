Answering a fan who questioned if the community could take action "to help abolish the Reserved List ", Rosewater replied that Magic's designers "know the majority of players would like.</p><img src ="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fZnqadLZB90/maxresdefault.jpg" style="width:100%;text-align:center;" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https://ts2.mm.bing.net/th?q=magic-the-gathering-reserved-list-goes-crazy-climbs-to-all-time.webp';"><br><h3>Magic the gathering Reserved list goes crazy!Climbs to all time</h3><p>What Does MTG Reserved List Mean? The Reserved List means that MTG will never reprint certain cards in a tournament-legal paper set, either literally or via a functionally identical card. This restriction includes promotional products like Judge Gifts and the Secret Lairs, so there's zero chance we'll ever see new Black Lotuses.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fZnqadLZB90">

Well, that's the short definition. Here's one that goes in more detail: Reserved cards will never be printed again in a functionally identical form. Two cards are considered functionally identical to one another if they have the same card type, subtypes, abilities, mana.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/skDQJJqxlbU">
