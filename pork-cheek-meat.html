When cooked slowly over low heat, pork cheeks become very tender and flavorful.</p><img src ="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/ba/27/46/ba2746dd24170cb3b589ce2c73a59e3c.jpg" style="width:100%;text-align:center;" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https://ts2.mm.bing.net/th?q=pork-chili-recipe-pork-chili-ground-pork-chili.webp';"><br><h3>Pork chili recipe, Pork chili, Ground pork chili</h3><p>Pork cheek meat has a thin membrane that should be removed to ensure tenderness.
