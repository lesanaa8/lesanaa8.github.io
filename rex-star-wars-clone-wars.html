While Alpha-17 stood out in the comic book series, Captain Rex is a more important character from a legacy standpoint. Where Alpha had been a more serious character, the kid-friendly animation format of Clone Wars made Rex more personable than his comic book counterpart.</p><br>    <ul class="list-group">
